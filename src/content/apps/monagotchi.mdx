        self.happiness = 80
        self.cleanliness = 100
    
    def feed(self):
        if self.hunger > 0:
            self.hunger = max(0, self.hunger - 20)
            self.happiness += 5
    
    def play(self):
        self.happiness = min(100, self.happiness + 15)
        self.hunger += 5
        self.cleanliness -= 10
    
    def clean(self):
        self.cleanliness = 100
        self.happiness += 10
    
    def display(self):

## Code Example

Here's how the pet state is managed:

from badger2350 import Badger2350
import json
import time

badge = Badger2350()

class Monagotchi:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hunger = 100
        self.happiness = 100
        self.cleanliness = 100
        self.last_update = time.time()
    
    def update_needs(self):
        # Needs decrease over time
        time_passed = time.time() - self.last_update
        hours = time_passed / 3600
        
        self.hunger = max(0, self.hunger - hours * 10)
        self.happiness = max(0, self.happiness - hours * 5)
        self.cleanliness = max(0, self.cleanliness - hours * 3)
        
        self.last_update = time.time()
    
    def feed(self):
        self.hunger = min(100, self.hunger + 30)
    
    def play(self):
        self.happiness = min(100, self.happiness + 25)
    
    def clean(self):
        self.cleanliness = min(100, self.cleanliness + 40)
```
