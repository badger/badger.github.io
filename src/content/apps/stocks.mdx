# Stock Tracker

Monitor real-time stock market prices on your Badger 2350. Track S&P 500 (VOO), Microsoft (MSFT), Figma (FIG), and Apple (AAPL) with live price updates and percentage changes.

## Features

- **Live Stock Prices**: Real-time market data from Yahoo Finance API
- **Major Tech Stocks**: Track MSFT, AAPL, and FIG alongside S&P 500 index
- **Price Movement**: Color-coded gains (green) and losses (red) with percentages
- **Auto-Refresh**: Automatically updates prices every 60 seconds
- **Manual Refresh**: Press B button to refresh prices on demand
- **WiFi Integration**: Connects using credentials from `/secrets.py`
- **Market-Ready UI**: Clean GitHub-themed interface with professional stock display

## Tracked Stocks

- **VOO**: Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (Market Index)
- **MSFT**: Microsoft Corporation
- **FIG**: Figma Inc.
- **AAPL**: Apple Inc.

## Controls

- **B Button**: Manually refresh stock prices
- Auto-refresh occurs every 60 seconds when connected

## Install

1. Copy the `stocks/` folder to `/apps/stocks/` on the BADGER drive while in USB storage mode
2. Ensure `/secrets.py` is configured with WiFi credentials (see Configuration below)
3. Eject, reboot, and launch Stock Tracker from the menu

## File Layout

```
/apps/stocks/
  ├── __init__.py   # Main app with market data integration
  └── icon.png      # App icon for the launcher
```

## Configuration

Create or edit `/secrets.py` on your badge:

```python
# WiFi credentials
WIFI_SSID = "YourNetworkName"
WIFI_PASSWORD = "YourPassword"

# Your GitHub username (optional for this app)
GITHUB_USERNAME = "yourusername"
```

**Required Variables:**
- `WIFI_SSID`: Your WiFi network name
- `WIFI_PASSWORD`: Your WiFi password

## How It Works

1. **WiFi Connection**: Connects to WiFi using credentials from `/secrets.py`
2. **Market Data Fetching**: Queries Yahoo Finance API for each stock symbol
3. **Real-time Display**: Shows current price, daily change, and percentage movement
4. **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 60 seconds during market hours
5. **Color Coding**: Green for gains, red for losses, gray for unchanged

## Technical Details

- Uses Yahoo Finance public API (no API key required)
- Efficient memory management with garbage collection
- 60-second WiFi connection timeout
- Graceful error handling with clear status messages
- Price formatting with appropriate decimal places
- Displays after-hours prices when markets are closed

## Market Hours Note

Stock prices update in real-time during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET, Monday-Friday). Outside market hours, the app displays the most recent closing prices.

## Troubleshooting

**"No WiFi Config" message:**
- Edit `/secrets.py` with your WiFi credentials
- Ensure WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASSWORD are set correctly

**"Connection Failed" message:**
- Verify WiFi credentials are correct
- Check that your network is 2.4GHz (Badger 2350 doesn't support 5GHz)
- Move closer to your WiFi router

**Prices showing as $0.00:**
- Check internet connection
- Stock symbol may be invalid or delisted
- API may be temporarily unavailable - press B to retry

**Prices not updating:**
- Markets may be closed (weekends, holidays, after-hours)
- Press B button to manually refresh
- Check WiFi connection status

## Customization

Edit the `STOCKS` list in `__init__.py` to track different stocks:

```python
STOCKS = [
    ("GOOGL", "Google"),
    ("TSLA", "Tesla"),
    ("NVDA", "NVIDIA"),
    ("META", "Meta")
]
```
