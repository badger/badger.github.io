# Mona's Quest

An interactive scavenger hunt game using IR beacons placed at various locations around GitHub Universe. Find all 9 locations to complete the quest!

## Features

- **IR Beacon Detection**: Uses infrared signals to detect when you're at quest locations
- **9 Quest Locations**: Find Hack Your Badge, What's Up Docs, Stars Lounge, GitHub Next, Open Source Zone, Demos & Donuts, GitHub Learn, Octocat Generator, and Makerspace
- **Real-Time Progress**: Visual grid shows which locations you've discovered
- **Animated Feedback**: Zoom-in celebration animation when you find each location
- **Persistent Progress**: Your quest progress is automatically saved between sessions

## File Location

Mona's Quest is located at `/system/apps/quest` on your Badger 2350 filesystem.

```
/system/apps/quest/
  ├── __init__.py      # Main game file
  ├── beacon.py        # IR beacon detection logic
  ├── ui.py            # User interface rendering
  └── assets/          # Game graphics
```

## Quest Locations

The 9 locations you need to find:

1. **Hack Your Badge** - Start here!
2. **What's Up Docs** - Documentation station
3. **Stars Lounge** - Community area
4. **GitHub Next** - Innovation showcase
5. **Open Source Zone** - OSS projects
6. **Demos & Donuts** - Live demonstrations
7. **GitHub Learn** - Learning resources
8. **Octocat Generator** - Create your Octocat
9. **Makerspace** - Hands-on activities

## How It Works

The quest uses **NEC IR protocol** to detect beacons:
- Each location has an IR beacon transmitting a unique code
- Your badge's IR receiver (GPIO pin 21) detects these signals
- When you get close to a beacon, the location is automatically unlocked
- A celebratory animation plays showing which location you found

## Progress Tracking

Your progress is saved automatically in the badge's state system:

```python
state = {
  "completed": [1, 2, 3]  # IDs of completed quests
}
```

## Tips

- **Start at Hack Your Badge**: The first station will get you oriented
- **Watch the Screen**: The grid shows all locations and marks completed ones
- **Get Close**: IR signals have limited range - move closer to beacons
- **Complete the Set**: Finding all 9 locations shows a special completion message
- **Progress Persists**: Your discoveries are saved even when the badge powers off

## Technical Details

- **IR Protocol**: NEC infrared remote control protocol
- **Receiver Pin**: GPIO 21
- **State Management**: Uses the badge's State.save/load system
- **Button Codes**: Each location has a unique code (0x11, 0x22, 0x33, etc.)

## How to Play

### Getting Started

1. Launch Mona's Quest from the app menu
2. Start at the "Hack the Badge" station at GitHub Universe
3. Follow the on-screen instructions and clues
4. Navigate using the badge buttons
5. Find all treasures to complete the quest!

### Controls

- **Button A/B/C/D**: Navigate and select options
- **Button E**: Open menu / Go back

### Game Progression

The game saves your progress automatically, so you can pick up where you left off. Each treasure you find unlocks new clues and areas to explore.

## Tips & Tricks

- Pay attention to clues at each station
- Talk to other badge hackers for hints
- Some treasures are hidden in plain sight
- Check the Hack the Badge station first for your starting clue
- Your progress is saved, so explore at your own pace

## Code Example

Here's how the treasure detection works:

```python
from badger2350 import Badger2350
import json

badge = Badger2350()

def check_treasure_found(location_id):
    with open('/apps/monaquest/progress.json', 'r') as f:
        progress = json.load(f)
    
    if location_id not in progress['found_treasures']:
        progress['found_treasures'].append(location_id)
        progress['total_found'] += 1
        
        with open('/apps/monaquest/progress.json', 'w') as f:
            json.dump(progress, f)
        
        return True
    return False
```
