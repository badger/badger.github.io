# Commits

Brick breaker, but every tile is a GitHub contribution square. Deflect the build ball, clear the wall, and chase a perfect green merge streak.

## Features

- **GitHub Palette**: Commit bricks cycle through the three GitHub green levels on every spawn.
- **Paddle AI**: Hold nothing and press **Down** to enable auto-play that targets the brightest remaining brick.
- **Breakout Core**: Three lives, score readout, win screen once every commit tile is cleared.
- **Adaptive Restart**: Auto mode resets instantly after a miss, manual mode costs a life and restarts the volley.

## Controls

- **A / C**: Move the paddle left or right.
- **B**: Launch the ball from centre serve.
- **Down**: Toggle auto-play (press again or touch the paddle to resume manual control).

## Install

1. Grab the `badge/apps/commits/` folder from [`badger/tufty`](https://github.com/badger/tufty/tree/main/badge/apps/commits).
2. Copy it to `/apps/commits/` on the BADGER USB drive.
3. Eject, reboot, and the launcher picks up the new app automatically.

## File Layout
