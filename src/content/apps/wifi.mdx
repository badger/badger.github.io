# WiFi Settings

A utility app for viewing and managing WiFi connection settings on your Badger 2350. Displays your network configuration, connection status, and provides real-time connection monitoring.

## Features

- **Settings Display**: View configured WiFi SSID and password (masked)
- **Connection Status**: Real-time WiFi connection status monitoring
- **GitHub Username**: Displays configured GitHub username
- **Password Masking**: Securely displays password with masking (first 2 and last 2 chars visible)
- **Auto-Connect**: Automatically attempts to connect to configured network
- **Retry Logic**: Smart retry with 15-second delays after failed attempts
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded connection status (green=connected, red=failed)
- **Configuration Helper**: Guides you to edit settings via USB mode

## Display Information

- **Network**: Configured WiFi SSID (network name)
- **Password**: Masked password display (e.g., "ab******89")
- **GitHub User**: Configured GitHub username
- **Status**: Current connection state with color indicators

## Connection States

- **Connected** (Green): Successfully connected to WiFi
- **Connecting...** (Yellow/Phosphor): Connection attempt in progress
- **Connection failed** (Red): Connection attempt timed out
- **Retry in Xs** (Gray): Waiting before next connection attempt
- **Not Connected** (Gray): No connection attempt yet

## Install

1. Copy the `wifi/` folder to `/apps/wifi/` on the BADGER drive while in USB storage mode
2. Ensure `/secrets.py` is configured with WiFi credentials (see Configuration below)
3. Eject, reboot, and launch WiFi Settings from the menu

## File Layout

```
/apps/wifi/
  ├── __init__.py   # WiFi settings viewer and connection monitor
  └── icon.png      # App icon for the launcher
```

## Configuration

Create or edit `/secrets.py` on your badge:

```python
# WiFi credentials
WIFI_SSID = "YourNetworkName"
WIFI_PASSWORD = "YourPassword"

# Your GitHub username
GITHUB_USERNAME = "yourusername"
```

**Required Variables:**
- `WIFI_SSID`: Your WiFi network name
- `WIFI_PASSWORD`: Your WiFi password
- `GITHUB_USERNAME`: Your GitHub username (optional)

## How It Works

1. **Settings Loading**: Reads WiFi credentials from `/secrets.py`
2. **Display**: Shows network name, masked password, and GitHub username
3. **Connection Monitoring**: Continuously checks WiFi connection status
4. **Auto-Connect**: Attempts to connect if not already connected
5. **Smart Retry**: Waits 15 seconds between failed connection attempts
6. **Status Updates**: Real-time color-coded status display

## Technical Details

- Password masking for security (shows first/last 2 chars only)
- 15-second timeout per connection attempt
- 15-second retry delay after failed attempts
- Text wrapping for long messages
- Centered text rendering for clean UI
- Color-coded status indicators
- SSID truncation for long network names (20 char max display)

## Use Cases

**Check Configuration:**
- Verify WiFi settings are loaded correctly
- Check GitHub username configuration
- See which network the badge is configured for

**Monitor Connection:**
- Watch connection status in real-time
- Troubleshoot connection issues
- Verify successful connection before using WiFi apps

**Configuration Guide:**
- Provides instructions if `/secrets.py` is missing
- Guides users to edit settings via USB disk mode

## Security Note

The WiFi Settings app masks your password for security:
- Passwords under 4 characters: fully masked (****)
- Longer passwords: shows first 2 and last 2 chars (ab****89)
- This prevents shoulder-surfing while confirming settings

## Troubleshooting

**"No Configuration" message:**
- `/secrets.py` file is missing from the badge
- Mount badge in USB mode
- Create `/secrets.py` with WiFi credentials

**"Connection failed" status:**
- Verify WiFi password is correct
- Check that SSID matches your network name exactly
- Ensure network is 2.4GHz (Badger doesn't support 5GHz)
- Check WiFi router is powered on and in range

**"Retry in Xs" displayed:**
- Previous connection attempt failed
- App is waiting before retrying automatically
- Wait for countdown or restart app to retry immediately

**Long SSID cut off:**
- SSIDs longer than 20 characters are truncated with "..."
- This is display-only; full SSID is used for connection

## Best Practices

1. **Use USB Mode to Edit**: Always edit `/secrets.py` via USB disk mode
2. **Double-Check Credentials**: Verify SSID and password are exact
3. **Test After Changes**: Launch WiFi Settings app after editing secrets
4. **Monitor Connection**: Watch the status to confirm successful connection
5. **Use with Other Apps**: Check WiFi Settings before using weather, stocks, or crypto apps

## Related Apps

WiFi Settings is designed to work alongside WiFi-dependent apps:
- **Crypto Tracker**: Requires WiFi for price data
- **Stock Tracker**: Requires WiFi for market data
- **Weather**: Requires WiFi for weather data
- **Badge**: Requires WiFi for GitHub profile data
