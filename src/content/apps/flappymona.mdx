# Flappy Mona

The addictive Flappy Bird-style game featuring Mona! Tap to flap and navigate through obstacles to achieve the highest score possible.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Tap to flap, avoid pipes
- **High Score System**: Track your best runs
- **E-ink Optimized**: Smooth animations for e-ink display
- **Increasing Difficulty**: Pipes get trickier as you progress
- **One-Button Control**: Simple and addictive

## File Location

Flappy Mona is located at `/apps/flappymona` on your Badger 2350 filesystem.

  ├── game_logic.py    # Physics and collision
  ├── sprites/         # Mona and pipe graphics
  └── highscores.json  # Your best scores
```

## How to Play

### Controls

- **Button A**: Flap (make Mona fly up)
- **Button E**: Start game / Return to menu

### Gameplay

1. Press Button A to start
2. Tap Button A to make Mona flap and fly upward
3. Release to let gravity pull Mona down
4. Navigate through gaps between pipes
5. Each pipe passed = 1 point
6. Collision ends the game

### Scoring

- **1 point**: For each pipe successfully passed
- **Bronze Medal**: Score 10+
- **Silver Medal**: Score 25+
- **Gold Medal**: Score 50+

  "medals": {
    "bronze": true,
    "silver": true,
    "gold": false
  }
}
```

## Tips & Tricks

- **Gentle Taps**: Small, frequent taps work better than holding
- **Find Your Rhythm**: Establish a consistent tapping pattern
- **Watch Ahead**: Look at upcoming pipes, not just Mona
- **Center Position**: Stay near the middle of the screen when possible
- **Practice Mode**: Play repeatedly to learn pipe patterns
- **Stay Calm**: Panic leads to overcorrection!

## Game Physics

- **Gravity**: Constant downward acceleration
- **Flap Force**: Each button press gives upward velocity
- **Terminal Velocity**: Maximum fall speed is capped
- **Collision**: Any contact with pipes or ground ends game

## Code Example

Basic flappy game mechanics:

```python
from badger2350 import Badger2350
import random

badge = Badger2350()

class FlappyMona:
    def __init__(self):
        self.y = 64  # Mona's vertical position
        self.velocity = 0
        self.gravity = 0.5
        self.flap_power = -8
        self.pipes = []
        self.score = 0
    
    def flap(self):
        self.velocity = self.flap_power
    
    def update(self):
        # Apply gravity
        self.velocity += self.gravity
        self.y += self.velocity
        
        # Check boundaries
        if self.y < 0 or self.y > 128:
            return False  # Game over
        
        # Move pipes
        for pipe in self.pipes:
            pipe['x'] -= 2
            
            # Check collision
            if pipe['x'] < 30 and pipe['x'] > 10:
                if self.y < pipe['gap_top'] or self.y > pipe['gap_bottom']:
                    return False  # Hit pipe
        
        return True
    
    def draw(self):
        badge.set_pen(15)
        badge.clear()
        
        # Draw Mona
        badge.circle(20, int(self.y), 8)
        
        # Draw pipes
        for pipe in self.pipes:
            badge.rectangle(pipe['x'], 0, 20, pipe['gap_top'])
            badge.rectangle(pipe['x'], pipe['gap_bottom'], 20, 128)
        
        # Draw score
        badge.text(f"Score: {self.score}", 10, 10)
        
        badge.update()
```

## How to Play

### Controls

- **Button A**: Flap (make Mona fly up)
- **Button E**: Restart / Return to menu

### Gameplay

1. Mona falls down automatically due to gravity
2. Tap Button A to flap and fly upward
3. Navigate through the gaps between pipes
4. Each pipe you pass scores 1 point
5. Game ends if Mona hits a pipe or the ground

### Scoring

- **1 point** per pipe successfully passed
- Your high score is automatically saved
- Try to beat your personal best!

## Tips & Tricks

- **Timing is Everything**: Don't flap too early or too late
- **Find Your Rhythm**: Regular tapping works better than frantic mashing
- **Watch Ahead**: Look at the next pipe while passing the current one
- **Stay Centered**: Try to keep Mona in the middle of the screen
- **Practice Makes Perfect**: The more you play, the better you'll get
- **Start Small**: Focus on passing 5 pipes, then 10, then 20+

## Difficulty Progression

- **0-10 pipes**: Beginner - Wide gaps, slow speed
- **11-20 pipes**: Intermediate - Narrower gaps
- **21+ pipes**: Expert - Fast speed, requires precision

## Code Example

Here's how the flappy mechanics work:

```python
from badger2350 import Badger2350
import time

badge = Badger2350()

class FlappyMona:
    def __init__(self):
        self.y = badge.height // 2
        self.velocity = 0
        self.gravity = 0.5
        self.flap_strength = -8
    
    def flap(self):
        self.velocity = self.flap_strength
    
    def update(self):
        # Apply gravity
        self.velocity += self.gravity
        self.y += self.velocity
        
        # Keep on screen
        if self.y < 0:
            self.y = 0
            self.velocity = 0
        elif self.y > badge.height:
            return False  # Game over
        
        return True
    
    def draw(self):
        badge.set_pen(0)
        # Draw Mona sprite
        badge.circle(20, int(self.y), 8)

# Main game loop
mona = FlappyMona()
while True:
    if badge.pressed(badge.BUTTON_A):
        mona.flap()
    
    if not mona.update():
        break  # Game over
    
    badge.set_pen(15)
    badge.clear()
    mona.draw()
    badge.update()
    time.sleep(0.03)
```
