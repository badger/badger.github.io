# Flappy Mona

The classic Flappy Bird game with Mona! Features beautiful parallax scrolling backgrounds, smooth physics, and three game states: intro, playing, and game over.

## Features

- **Smooth Physics**: Gravity-based movement with flap mechanics
- **Parallax Scrolling**: Multi-layer background with grass and clouds
- **Obstacle System**: Procedurally spawned obstacles with gaps
- **Score Tracking**: Points earned for each obstacle passed
- **Game States**: Intro screen → Playing → Game Over loop
- **Ghost Mode**: When Mona dies, she becomes a ghost sprite

## File Location

Flappy Mona is located at `/system/apps/flappy` on your Badger 2350 filesystem.

/system/apps/flappy/

  ├── mona.py          # Mona character physics and collision
  ├── obstacle.py      # Obstacle spawning and movement
  └── assets/          # Background layers and sprites
```

## How to Play

### Controls

- **Button A**: Jump/Flap (in intro, playing, and restart)

### Game States

**1. INTRO State:**
- Shows "FLAPPY MONA" title
- Blinking "Press A to start" message
- Background scrolls continuously
- Press A to begin

**2. PLAYING State:**
- Press A to make Mona jump
- Avoid obstacles (top and bottom barriers)
- Score increases as you pass obstacles
- Background parallax scrolls at different speeds
- Obstacles spawn every 500ms after first spawn

**3. GAME OVER State:**
- Shows "GAME OVER!" and final score
- Blinking "Press A to restart" message
- Background stops scrolling
- Press A to return to intro

### Scoring

Points are earned by passing obstacles. The longer you survive, the higher your score!

## Visual Elements

**Background Layers (Parallax):**
1. **Sky**: Bright blue background (73, 219, 255)
2. **Distant background**: Mountains/hills, scrolls at 1/8 speed
3. **Clouds**: Cloud layer, scrolls at 1/8 speed
4. **Grass**: Foreground grass, scrolls at 1/4 speed (fastest)

All layers scroll continuously in intro and playing states, creating depth.

**Fonts:**
- **Large font**: "ziplock.ppf" for titles
- **Small font**: "nope.ppf" for score and messages

## Game Mechanics

**Mona Character:**
- Starts at center of screen
- Affected by gravity
- Jump/flap on Button A press
- Collision detection with obstacles
- When dies: becomes ghost sprite, falls to bottom
- `is_dead()` and `is_done_dying()` methods control game flow

**Obstacles:**
- Spawn timer controlled by `Obstacle.next_spawn_time`
- Move from right to left across screen
- Top and bottom barriers with gap in middle
- Static obstacle class manages all active obstacles
- Collision detection with Mona's position

## Tips & Tricks

- **Timing is everything**: Learn the rhythm of tapping
- **Watch the parallax**: Use background scrolling to gauge speed
- **Stay centered**: Avoid top and bottom edges
- **Practice jumps**: Each tap gives consistent upward force
- **Death is learning**: Ghost animation shows your final moments!

## Technical Implementation

**State Machine:**
```python
class GameState:
    INTRO = 1
    PLAYING = 2
    GAME_OVER = 3
```

**Background Scrolling:**
- Offset increments each frame
- Modulo arithmetic for seamless looping
- Different scroll speeds create parallax effect

## How to Play

### Controls

- **Button A**: Flap (make Mona fly up)
- **Button E**: Restart / Return to menu

### Gameplay

1. Mona falls down automatically due to gravity
2. Tap Button A to flap and fly upward
3. Navigate through the gaps between pipes
4. Each pipe you pass scores 1 point
5. Game ends if Mona hits a pipe or the ground

### Scoring

- **1 point** per pipe successfully passed
- Your high score is automatically saved
- Try to beat your personal best!

## Tips & Tricks

- **Timing is Everything**: Don't flap too early or too late
- **Find Your Rhythm**: Regular tapping works better than frantic mashing
- **Watch Ahead**: Look at the next pipe while passing the current one
- **Stay Centered**: Try to keep Mona in the middle of the screen
- **Practice Makes Perfect**: The more you play, the better you'll get
- **Start Small**: Focus on passing 5 pipes, then 10, then 20+

## Difficulty Progression

- **0-10 pipes**: Beginner - Wide gaps, slow speed
- **11-20 pipes**: Intermediate - Narrower gaps
- **21+ pipes**: Expert - Fast speed, requires precision

## Code Example

Here's how the flappy mechanics work:

```python
from badger2350 import Badger2350
import time

badge = Badger2350()

class FlappyMona:
    def __init__(self):
        self.y = badge.height // 2
        self.velocity = 0
        self.gravity = 0.5
        self.flap_strength = -8
    
    def flap(self):
        self.velocity = self.flap_strength
    
    def update(self):
        # Apply gravity
        self.velocity += self.gravity
        self.y += self.velocity
        
        # Keep on screen
        if self.y < 0:
            self.y = 0
            self.velocity = 0
        elif self.y > badge.height:
            return False  # Game over
        
        return True
    
    def draw(self):
        badge.set_pen(0)
        # Draw Mona sprite
        badge.circle(20, int(self.y), 8)

# Main game loop
mona = FlappyMona()
while True:
    if badge.pressed(badge.BUTTON_A):
        mona.flap()
    
    if not mona.update():
        break  # Game over
    
    badge.set_pen(15)
    badge.clear()
    mona.draw()
    badge.update()
    time.sleep(0.03)
```
