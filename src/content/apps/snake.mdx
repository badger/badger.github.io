# Snake

Guide a neon-green snake across a GitHub-dark grid, merge commits, and stretch the repo history without colliding with yourself.

## Features

- **GitHub Grid**: 40×30 board rendered with the familiar contribution green palette.
- **Smooth Ticks**: Logic ticks every 150ms for predictable pacing that speeds up only with your mistakes.
- **Scoreboard**: Merge count follows you across intro, play, and game over screens.
- **Clean State Reset**: Intro screen respawns the snake and places a fresh commit square each run.

## Controls

- **A**: Move left
- **C**: Move right
- **Up / Down**: Move vertically
- **A (on intro/game over)**: Start or restart the run

## Install

1. Copy the `badge/apps/snake/` folder from [`badger/home`](https://github.com/badger/home/tree/main/badge/apps/snake).
2. Drop it into `/apps/snake/` on the BADGER drive while the badge is in USB storage mode.
3. Eject, reboot, and launch Snake from the menu.
