# Crypto Tracker

Track real-time cryptocurrency prices directly on your Badger 2350. Displays live prices for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Ripple (XRP) with price changes and percentage movements.

## Features

- **Live Price Updates**: Real-time cryptocurrency prices from Yahoo Finance API
- **Four Major Cryptos**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Ripple tracking
- **Price Change Indicators**: Green for gains, red for losses with percentage changes
- **Auto-Refresh**: Automatically updates prices every 60 seconds
- **Manual Refresh**: Press B button to refresh prices on demand
- **WiFi Integration**: Connects to WiFi using credentials from `/secrets.py`
- **Clean UI**: GitHub-themed dark interface with color-coded price movements

## Tracked Cryptocurrencies

- **Bitcoin (BTC-USD)**: The original cryptocurrency
- **Ethereum (ETH-USD)**: Smart contract platform
- **Dogecoin (DOGE-USD)**: The people's crypto
- **Ripple (XRP-USD)**: Digital payment protocol

## Controls

- **B Button**: Manually refresh cryptocurrency prices
- Auto-refresh occurs every 60 seconds when connected

## Install

1. Copy the `crypto/` folder to `/apps/crypto/` on the BADGER drive while in USB storage mode
2. Ensure `/secrets.py` is configured with WiFi credentials (see Configuration below)
3. Eject, reboot, and launch Crypto Tracker from the menu

## File Layout

```
/apps/crypto/
  ├── __init__.py   # Main app with API integration and price display
  └── icon.png      # App icon for the launcher
```

## Configuration

Create or edit `/secrets.py` on your badge:

```python
# WiFi credentials
WIFI_SSID = "YourNetworkName"
WIFI_PASSWORD = "YourPassword"

# Your GitHub username (optional for this app)
GITHUB_USERNAME = "yourusername"
```

**Required Variables:**
- `WIFI_SSID`: Your WiFi network name
- `WIFI_PASSWORD`: Your WiFi password

## How It Works

1. **WiFi Connection**: Connects to WiFi using credentials from `/secrets.py`
2. **Price Fetching**: Queries Yahoo Finance API for each cryptocurrency
3. **Real-time Display**: Shows current price, daily change, and percentage movement
4. **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 60 seconds automatically
5. **Color Coding**: Green text for positive changes, red for negative, gray for no change

## Technical Details

- Uses Yahoo Finance public API (no API key required)
- Implements efficient memory management with garbage collection
- 60-second WiFi connection timeout
- Handles network errors gracefully with error messages
- Price formatting adapts based on crypto value (more decimals for sub-$1 coins)

## Troubleshooting

**"No WiFi Config" message:**
- Edit `/secrets.py` with your WiFi credentials
- Ensure WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASSWORD are set correctly

**"Connection Failed" message:**
- Verify WiFi credentials are correct
- Check that your network is 2.4GHz (Badger 2350 doesn't support 5GHz)
- Move closer to your WiFi router

**Prices showing as $0.00:**
- Check internet connection
- API may be temporarily unavailable - wait and refresh
- Press B button to manually retry fetching
