# Weather

Get real-time weather information on your Badger 2350. Automatically detects your location and displays current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

## Features

- **Auto-Location Detection**: Automatically detects your location from IP address
- **Current Weather**: Real-time temperature, humidity, and wind speed
- **Weather Conditions**: Clear descriptions of current weather (Clear, Cloudy, Rain, etc.)
- **No API Key Required**: Uses free Open-Meteo weather API
- **Auto-Refresh**: Updates weather data every 60 seconds
- **Manual Refresh**: Press B button to refresh weather on demand
- **WiFi Integration**: Connects using credentials from `/secrets.py`
- **Clean Display**: GitHub-themed interface with color-coded weather info

## Weather Data

- **Temperature**: Displayed in Fahrenheit
- **Humidity**: Relative humidity percentage
- **Wind Speed**: Current wind speed in mph
- **Conditions**: Weather description (Clear, Cloudy, Rain, Snow, etc.)
- **Location**: Auto-detected city name

## Controls

- **B Button**: Manually refresh weather data
- Auto-refresh occurs every 60 seconds when connected

## Install

1. Copy the `weather/` folder to `/apps/weather/` on the BADGER drive while in USB storage mode
2. Ensure `/secrets.py` is configured with WiFi credentials (see Configuration below)
3. Eject, reboot, and launch Weather from the menu

## File Layout

```
/apps/weather/
  ├── __init__.py   # Main app with weather API and location detection
  └── icon.png      # App icon for the launcher
```

## Configuration

Create or edit `/secrets.py` on your badge:

```python
# WiFi credentials
WIFI_SSID = "YourNetworkName"
WIFI_PASSWORD = "YourPassword"

# Your GitHub username (optional for this app)
GITHUB_USERNAME = "yourusername"
```

**Required Variables:**
- `WIFI_SSID`: Your WiFi network name
- `WIFI_PASSWORD`: Your WiFi password

## How It Works

1. **WiFi Connection**: Connects to WiFi using credentials from `/secrets.py`
2. **Location Detection**: Automatically detects location from IP using ipapi.co
3. **Weather Fetching**: Queries Open-Meteo API with detected coordinates
4. **Real-time Display**: Shows temperature, humidity, wind, and conditions
5. **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 60 seconds automatically
6. **Fallback Location**: Defaults to San Francisco if detection fails

## Technical Details

- Uses Open-Meteo free weather API (no API key required)
- Location detection via ipapi.co (free IP geolocation)
- WMO (World Meteorological Organization) weather codes
- Temperature in Fahrenheit, wind speed in mph
- Efficient memory management with garbage collection
- 60-second WiFi connection timeout
- Graceful error handling with status messages

## Weather Conditions

The app interprets WMO weather codes to display clear conditions:
- **Clear**: Clear skies
- **Partly Cloudy**: Some cloud cover
- **Cloudy**: Overcast
- **Fog**: Foggy conditions
- **Drizzle/Rain**: Light or heavy rain
- **Snow**: Snow or freezing conditions
- **Thunderstorm**: Stormy weather

## Location Detection

The app automatically detects your location using your IP address. This means:
- ✅ No manual configuration needed
- ✅ Works anywhere with WiFi
- ✅ Updates if you travel to a new location
- ⚠️ May be less accurate than GPS (usually city-level accuracy)
- ⚠️ Falls back to San Francisco if detection fails

## Troubleshooting

**"No Configuration" message:**
- Edit `/secrets.py` with your WiFi credentials
- Ensure WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASSWORD are set correctly

**"Location detection failed":**
- App will default to San Francisco weather
- Check internet connection
- Press B button to retry

**Weather data not displaying:**
- Check WiFi connection
- Verify internet connectivity
- API may be temporarily unavailable - wait and refresh

**Wrong location detected:**
- Location is based on IP address (VPN may affect this)
- You can manually edit the code to set LATITUDE/LONGITUDE

## Customization

To use a specific location instead of auto-detection, edit `__init__.py`:

```python
# Set your desired location
LATITUDE = 40.7128   # New York City
LONGITUDE = -74.0060
LOCATION_NAME = "New York"
location_detected = True  # Skip auto-detection
```
