# Monasketch

An Etch-A-Sketch style drawing app with a twist - Mona runs away from your cursor! Create pixel art while Mona watches (and flees) from the sides.

## Features

- **Pixel-by-Pixel Drawing**: Move cursor continuously to draw lines
- **Interactive Mona**: Mona character reacts to your cursor position
- **Animated Dials**: Visual feedback showing cursor position
- **Continuous Drawing**: Hold buttons to draw smooth lines
- **Canvas Area**: Dedicated drawing space with Mona sidebars
- **Real-Time Rendering**: Instant visual feedback

## File Location

Monasketch is located at `/apps/sketch` on your Badger 2350 filesystem.

## How to Draw

### Controls

- **Button A**: Move cursor left
- **Button C**: Move cursor right  
- **Button UP (D-pad)**: Move cursor up
- **Button DOWN (D-pad)**: Move cursor down
- Hold buttons to draw continuously

### Drawing Mechanism

The app draws as your cursor moves:
- **Cursor update rate**: 20ms between movements when buttons held
- **Drawing color**: Gray pixels (105, 105, 105)
- **Pixel size**: 1x1 pixels
- **Canvas bounds**: Cursor is clamped within the drawing area

### Interactive Elements

**Mona's Behavior:**
- **Left side presence**: When cursor is on the left (x < 30), Mona runs to the right
- **Right side presence**: When cursor is on the right (x > canvas_width - 30), Mona runs to the left
- **Smooth movement**: Mona animates to her target position pixel by pixel
- **Direction indicator**: Mona faces the direction she's heading

**Visual Feedback:**
- **Animated dials**: Two dials at bottom corners rotate based on cursor position
  - Left dial: rotates based on horizontal position (-cursor.x * 3 degrees)
  - Right dial: rotates based on vertical position (cursor.y * 3 degrees)

## Drawing Canvas

**Canvas Specifications:**
- Canvas is an off-screen Image buffer
- Rendered to screen at position defined in `ui.canvas_area`
- Cursor starts at center of canvas
- Drawing persists as long as app is running (no save/load functionality)

## Tips for Drawing

- **Smooth lines**: Hold buttons down for continuous drawing
- **Keep Mona around**: Draw near the center to keep her visible
- **Chase Mona**: Move your cursor to make her run away
- **Watch the dials**: They show your cursor position at a glance
- **Precision**: Move slowly for detailed work
- **Speed**: Hold buttons longer for quick sketches

## Technical Details

**Canvas System:**
```python
canvas = Image(0, 0, canvas_width, canvas_height)
cursor = (canvas_width / 2, canvas_height / 2)
```

**Drawing Logic:**
- Cursor updates every 20ms when buttons held
- Draws 1x1 rectangle at cursor position if cursor moved
- Canvas is blitted to screen each frame
- Cursor position clamped to canvas bounds

**Mona AI:**
- Target position changes based on cursor proximity
- Moves 1 pixel per frame toward target
- Direction flips based on screen position
- Smoothly animated movement

## How to Draw

### Controls

- **Button A (Up)**: Draw upward
- **Button B (Left)**: Draw left
- **Button C (Right)**: Draw right
- **Button D (Down)**: Draw downward
- **Button E**: Menu (save, clear, exit)

### Drawing Techniques

**Straight Lines:**
- Hold a single direction button to draw straight lines
- Release to stop drawing

**Diagonal Lines:**
- Press **Up + Left** for top-left diagonal
- Press **Up + Right** for top-right diagonal
- Press **Down + Left** for bottom-left diagonal
- Press **Down + Right** for bottom-right diagonal

### Menu Options

Press Button E to access:
- **Save**: Save your current sketch
- **Load**: Load a previously saved sketch
- **Clear**: Clear the canvas and start fresh
- **Exit**: Return to app menu

## Drawing Tips

- Start with simple shapes before complex drawings
- Use diagonal combinations for more natural curves
- Take advantage of the e-ink display's high contrast
- Save your work frequently
- Experiment with different line patterns

## Creative Ideas

- Draw pixel art characters
- Create patterns and designs
- Make your own badge artwork
- Design mazes or puzzles
- Sketch diagrams and notes

## Code Example

Here's how the drawing system works:

```python
from badger2350 import Badger2350

badge = Badger2350()

class Canvas:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = badge.width // 2
        self.y = badge.height // 2
        self.drawing = False
    
    def draw_pixel(self):
        badge.set_pen(0)
        badge.pixel(self.x, self.y)
    
    def move(self, dx, dy):
        self.x = max(0, min(badge.width - 1, self.x + dx))
        self.y = max(0, min(badge.height - 1, self.y + dy))
        if self.drawing:
            self.draw_pixel()
    
    def handle_input(self):
        # Check button states
        dx, dy = 0, 0
        
        if badge.pressed(badge.BUTTON_A):  # Up
            dy = -1
        if badge.pressed(badge.BUTTON_D):  # Down
            dy = 1
        if badge.pressed(badge.BUTTON_B):  # Left
            dx = -1
        if badge.pressed(badge.BUTTON_C):  # Right
            dx = 1
        
        if dx != 0 or dy != 0:
            self.move(dx, dy)
```
