- **Experiment**: Try different button combinations

## Code Example

Basic drawing implementation:

```python
from badger2350 import Badger2350

badge = Badger2350()

class Sketch:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 148  # Center of screen
        self.y = 64
        self.lines = []
        self.drawing = False
    
    def draw_line(self, dx, dy):
        new_x = self.x + dx * 2
        new_y = self.y + dy * 2
        
        badge.line(self.x, self.y, new_x, new_y)
        badge.update()
        
        self.lines.append(((self.x, self.y), (new_x, new_y)))
        self.x = new_x
        self.y = new_y
    
    def clear_canvas(self):
        badge.set_pen(15)
        badge.clear()
        badge.update()
        self.lines = []
        self.x = 148
        self.y = 64

# Usage
sketch = Sketch()
# Button A pressed: sketch.draw_line(0, -1)  # Up
# Button C pressed: sketch.draw_line(1, 0)   # Right
# A + C pressed: sketch.draw_line(1, -1)     # Diagonal
```

- **Button A (Up)**: Draw upward
- **Button B (Left)**: Draw left
- **Button C (Right)**: Draw right
- **Button D (Down)**: Draw downward
- **Button E**: Menu (save, clear, exit)

### Drawing Techniques

## Code Example

Here's how the drawing system works:

```python
from badger2350 import Badger2350

badge = Badger2350()

class Canvas:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = badge.width // 2
        self.y = badge.height // 2
        self.drawing = False
    
    def draw_pixel(self):
        badge.set_pen(0)
        badge.pixel(self.x, self.y)
    
    def move(self, dx, dy):
        self.x = max(0, min(badge.width - 1, self.x + dx))
        self.y = max(0, min(badge.height - 1, self.y + dy))
        if self.drawing:
            self.draw_pixel()
    
    def handle_input(self):
        # Check button states
        dx, dy = 0, 0
        
        if badge.pressed(badge.BUTTON_A):  # Up
            dy = -1
        if badge.pressed(badge.BUTTON_D):  # Down
            dy = 1
        if badge.pressed(badge.BUTTON_B):  # Left
            dx = -1
        if badge.pressed(badge.BUTTON_C):  # Right
            dx = 1
        
        if dx != 0 or dy != 0:
            self.move(dx, dy)
```
