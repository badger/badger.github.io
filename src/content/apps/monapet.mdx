# Monapet

Your very own virtual Mona pet! Take care of your digital companion by playing, feeding, and keeping them clean. Watch Mona move around, react to your care, and show different moods.

## Features

- **Three Core Stats**: Happiness, Hunger, and Cleanliness that decay over time
- **Interactive Actions**: Play (shows heart), Feed (eating animation), Clean (dance animation)
- **Autonomous Behavior**: Mona moves to random locations every 5 seconds
- **Dynamic Moods**: Idle animations change every 8 seconds
- **Notification System**: Mona alerts you when stats drop below 30%
- **Death & Revival**: If neglected too much, Mona can "die" but be revived
- **Persistent State**: Your pet's stats are automatically saved

## File Location

Monapet is located at `/apps/monapet` on your Badger 2350 filesystem.

## How to Care for Your Monapet

### Three Stats to Manage

Each stat decays at a different rate:
- **Happiness**: Decreases to 0% in 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
- **Hunger**: Decreases to 0% in 20 minutes (1200 seconds) - fastest!
- **Cleanliness**: Decreases to 0% in 40 minutes (2400 seconds) - slowest

### Controls

- **Button A**: Play with Mona (+30 happiness, shows heart animation)
- **Button B**: Feed Mona (+30 hunger, shows eating animation)
- **Button C**: Clean Mona (+30 cleanliness, shows dance animation)
- **Button B** (when dead): Revive Mona and reset all stats

### Mona's Behavior

**Autonomous Actions:**
- Moves to a random screen position every 5 seconds
- Changes idle animation/mood every 8 seconds
- Shows notification mood when any stat drops below 30%

**When Neglected:**
- If any stat reaches critical levels, Mona becomes distressed
- Prolonged neglect leads to "death"
- When dead, Mona moves to screen center with a death animation
- Press Button B to revive and start fresh

## Visual Interface

The app displays:
- **Mona sprite**: Animated character that moves and reacts
- **Three progress bars**: Happiness (top), Hunger (middle), Cleanliness (bottom)
- **Action buttons**: Visual indicators at bottom showing which action is active
- **Background scene**: Decorative UI drawn behind Mona

## State Persistence

Your pet's state is saved using the badge's State system:

```python
state = {
  "happy": 100,
  "hunger": 100,
  "clean": 100
}
```

The app automatically:
- Loads saved stats when opened (`init()` function)
- Saves current stats when closed (`on_exit()` function)
- Tracks time delta to calculate stat decay accurately

## Tips for Success

- **Watch the bars**: Keep all three bars above 30% to avoid notifications
- **Hunger drops fastest**: Feed Mona more frequently than other actions
- **Cleanliness lasts longest**: You can be less vigilant about cleaning
- **Each button gives +30**: Plan your care based on the decay rates
- **Revival is free**: Don't worry if Mona "dies" - just press B to restart!
- **Mona is autonomous**: She'll move and change moods on her own

## Technical Implementation

- **Time-based stat decay**: Uses `io.ticks_delta` to calculate precise decay
- **Action cooldowns**: Animations play when buttons are pressed
- **Movement system**: Random target positions with smooth interpolation
- **Mood changes**: Automatic idle animation cycling
- **Sprite rendering**: Uses badge's sprite sheet system

## How to Play

### Pet Care Basics

Your Monapet needs regular attention to stay happy and healthy. Monitor the status bars to see what your pet needs:

- **Hunger**: Feed your pet when the hunger bar is low
- **Happiness**: Play with your pet to keep them happy
- **Cleanliness**: Clean your pet regularly to keep them fresh

### Controls

- **Button A**: Feed your pet
- **Button B**: Play with your pet
- **Button C**: Clean your pet
- **Button D**: Check stats
- **Button E**: Return to menu

### Pet States

Your Monapet can be in different moods:
- **Happy** üòä: All needs are met
- **Hungry** üçΩÔ∏è: Needs food
- **Bored** üòê: Wants to play
- **Dirty** üí¶: Needs cleaning
- **Sleeping** üò¥: Resting (less responsive)

## Tips for Pet Care

- Check on your pet regularly throughout the day
- Don't overfeed - your pet can get full
- Play sessions boost happiness significantly
- Keep all three stats balanced for maximum happiness
- Your pet's state persists even when the badge is off

## Code Example

Here's how the pet state is managed:

```python
from badger2350 import Badger2350
import json
import time

badge = Badger2350()

class Monapet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hunger = 100
        self.happiness = 100
        self.cleanliness = 100
        self.last_update = time.time()
    
    def update_needs(self):
        # Needs decrease over time
        time_passed = time.time() - self.last_update
        hours = time_passed / 3600
        
        self.hunger = max(0, self.hunger - hours * 10)
        self.happiness = max(0, self.happiness - hours * 5)
        self.cleanliness = max(0, self.cleanliness - hours * 3)
        
        self.last_update = time.time()
    
    def feed(self):
        self.hunger = min(100, self.hunger + 30)
    
    def play(self):
        self.happiness = min(100, self.happiness + 25)
    
    def clean(self):
        self.cleanliness = min(100, self.cleanliness + 40)
```
