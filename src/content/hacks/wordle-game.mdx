# Wordle Game

Bring the viral word-guessing phenomenon to your Badger 2350! This fully-featured implementation includes dictionary validation, color-coded feedback, and all the strategic gameplay of the original.

## What You'll Learn

- Complex user interface design
- File-based dictionary management
- Binary search algorithms
- Grid-based coordinate systems
- State machine programming
- Advanced input handling

## Hardware Requirements

- Badger 2350 (used in portrait mode)
- Dictionary files (`winners.txt`, `all_words.txt`)
- USB-C cable for programming

## How to Play

### Controls
- **B/C Buttons**: Cycle through alphabet (B=forward, C=backward)
- **UP/DOWN Arrows**: Move between grid positions
- **A Button**: Submit current word guess

### Objective
Guess the secret 5-letter word in 6 attempts or fewer!

### Feedback System
- **Black on White**: Correct letter in correct position
- **White on Gray**: Correct letter in wrong position  
- **White on Black**: Letter not in the word

## Technical Implementation

### Portrait Mode Display
The game rotates the standard landscape display:
```python
def conv_grid_coords(x, y):
    """Converts portrait grid coords into landscape grid coords"""
    return 5-y, x
```

### Dictionary Management
Uses two optimized word files:
- `winners.txt`: 2,309 possible answer words
- `all_words.txt`: 12,972 valid guess words

### Word Selection Algorithm
```python
def select_word():
    idx = random.randint(0, 2309)  # Random winner word
    f = open("/examples/winners.txt", "r")
    f.seek(idx * 5)  # Each word is exactly 5 characters
    winner_word = f.read(5)
    f.close()
    return winner_word.upper()
```

### Binary Search Validation
Efficiently validates guesses using binary search:
```python
def valid_word(word):
    word = word.lower()
    all_words.seek(0)
    lo, hi = 0, 12972
    
    while lo < hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2
        all_words.seek(mid * 5)
        if all_words.read(5) < word:
            lo = mid + 1
        else:
            hi = mid
    
    all_words.seek(lo * 5)
    return all_words.read(5) == word
```

## Grid System

### Cell Rendering
Each letter is displayed in a custom grid cell:
```python
def draw_cell(x, y, outline, fill, text, char):
    x, y = conv_grid_coords(x, y)  # Convert to portrait coords
    
    # Calculate cell position
    org_x = GRID_ORIGIN_X + CELL_SIDE*x + CELL_SPACING*x
    org_y = GRID_ORIGIN_Y + CELL_SIDE*y + CELL_SPACING*y
    
    # Draw cell background
    display.set_pen(fill)
    display.rectangle(org_x, org_y, CELL_SIDE+1, CELL_SIDE+1)
    
    # Draw outline if different from fill
    if outline != fill:
        display.set_pen(outline)
        # Draw borders...
```

### Grid Layout Constants
```python
CELL_SIDE = 23      # Cell size in pixels
CELL_SPACING = 3    # Space between cells
GRID_ORIGIN_X = int(HALF_W - (CELL_SIDE*3 + CELL_SPACING*2.5))
GRID_ORIGIN_Y = int(HALF_H - (CELL_SIDE*2.5 + CELL_SPACING*2))
```

## Game Logic

### Letter Input System
Navigate through the alphabet and grid positions:
```python
# Current position tracking
pos_x = 0  # Column (0-4)
pos_y = 0  # Row (0-5)
row = [""] * 5  # Current guess
row_char_idx = [-1] * 5  # Character indices

# Letter cycling
if display.pressed(BUTTON_B):
    row_char_idx[pos_x] = (row_char_idx[pos_x]+1) % 26
    row[pos_x] = LETTERS[row_char_idx[pos_x]]
```

### Word Validation and Feedback
```python
def check_guess(guess, target):
    feedback = []
    for i, letter in enumerate(guess):
        if letter == target[i]:
            feedback.append("correct")
        elif letter in target:
            feedback.append("wrong_position")
        else:
            feedback.append("not_in_word")
    return feedback
```

### Game State Management
Track progress through multiple attempts:
```python
grid = [[""] * 5] * 6  # 6 rows, 5 columns
current_row = 0
game_won = False
game_over = False
```

## Display Optimization

### Cell Style System
Different visual states for each cell:
```python
# Cell styling based on state
def style_cell(char, state):
    if state == "empty":
        return (outline=0, fill=15, text_color=0)  # Black outline, white fill
    elif state == "correct":
        return (outline=0, fill=15, text_color=0)  # Correct position
    elif state == "wrong_position":
        return (outline=0, fill=9, text_color=15)  # Gray fill, white text
    elif state == "not_in_word":
        return (outline=0, fill=0, text_color=15)  # Black fill, white text
```

### Memory Management
```python
import gc
gc.collect()  # Frequent garbage collection for large dictionaries
```

## Advanced Features

### File I/O Optimization
- Fixed-width file format for fast seeking
- Memory-efficient word loading
- Persistent dictionary caching

### Input Debouncing
Prevent accidental multiple inputs:
```python
if display.pressed(BUTTON_A):
    # Process guess
    sleep(0.2)  # Debounce delay
    continue
```

### Portrait Mode Handling
Complete coordinate system transformation for vertical display

## Installation

1. Copy these files to `/examples/` on your Badger 2350:
   - `wordle.py`
   - `icon-wordle.jpg`
   - `winners.txt` 
   - `all_words.txt`
2. Launch through the app menu

## Strategy Tips

### Starting Words
Good first guesses include common letters:
- AUDIO (vowel-heavy)
- STERN (common consonants)
- RAISE (balanced mix)

### Letter Frequency
Most common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R

### Elimination Strategy
- Use early guesses to eliminate common letters
- Pay attention to letter positioning
- Consider letter frequency in remaining possibilities

## Customization Ideas

### Dictionary Modifications
- Add themed word lists (technology, science, etc.)
- Create difficulty levels with word length variations
- Implement multi-language support

### Visual Enhancements
- Add animations for letter reveals
- Implement color coding improvements
- Create custom fonts for better readability

### Gameplay Variations
- **Absurdle**: Anti-Wordle that avoids giving you the answer
- **Dordle**: Play two Wordle games simultaneously
- **Quordle**: Four games at once

This implementation demonstrates sophisticated game development techniques and showcases the Badger 2350's capability for complex interactive applications!
