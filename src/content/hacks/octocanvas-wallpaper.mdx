# Render an Octocanvas Wallpaper

Octocanvas can export a 320×240 "Badge" wallpaper. Shrink that PNG to 160×120, drop it into the Gallery app, and it becomes a full-screen background on your badge.

## Prerequisites

- Web browser with access to [octocanvas.io](https://octocanvas.io)
- An image editor that can resize PNGs (Preview, Photos, Paint, or an online tool)
- Badge mounted as the badger volume

## Steps

1. **Generate the artwork**
   - Open [octocanvas.io](https://octocanvas.io).
   - Enter your GitHub username, pick colours/effects, and switch to the **Badge (320×240)** download. The code that powers this size sits in [`WallpaperGenerator.tsx`](https://github.com/github/octocanvas/blob/main/src/components/WallpaperGenerator.tsx#L34-L59).
   - Click **Download** → the file lands in `~/Downloads/octocanvas-badge.png` (name may vary).
2. **Downscale for the Gallery app (160×120)**
  - Open the downloaded PNG in your image editor.
  - Resize or export a copy at **160×120 px** named `octocanvas-gallery.png`.
3. **Create the thumbnail (60×45)**
  - Duplicate the 160×120 image, resize it to **60×45 px**, and save it as `octocanvas-gallery-thumb.png`.
4. **Copy into the Gallery app with Finder or File Explorer**
  - Drag `octocanvas-gallery.png` into `badger volume/apps/gallery/images/`.
  - Drag the thumbnail into `badger volume/apps/gallery/thumbnails/` and rename it to `octocanvas-gallery.png` so the filenames match.
5. **Review in VS Code**
  - In VS Code, open `badger volume/apps/gallery/` to double-check both PNGs are present with matching filenames.
6. **Eject + reset** the badge and open Gallery. Your wallpaper should sit alongside the stock art.

## Verify

- In Gallery, the new slide should display edge-to-edge with no stretching.
- The thumbnail strip shows your custom preview. If it’s blank, check that both PNGs share the same filename.

## Cleanup (optional)

Move any intermediate files (downloads and resized copies) to the trash once you are finished.
