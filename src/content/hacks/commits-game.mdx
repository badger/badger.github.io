# Add the Commits Brick-Breaker

Break through a contribution wall by copying the Commits game from the Tufty repository into your local `/apps` directory.

## Prerequisites

- Badge mounted as the badger volume
- The Tufty source ZIP downloaded from GitHub (reuse the archive from the Snake hack or grab a fresh one via **Code → Download ZIP**)

## Steps

1. **Copy the Commits folder with Finder or File Explorer**
  - Open the unzipped `tufty-main/badge/apps/commits` directory.
  - In another window, open `badger volume/apps/` (create `apps` if it is missing).
  - Drag the entire `commits` directory into `badger volume/apps/`. This brings over `__init__.py`, `icon.png`, and the `assets` sprites.
2. **Confirm the files in VS Code**
  - With the badger volume still connected, open VS Code and choose **File → Open...**.
  - Navigate to `badger volume/apps/commits/__init__.py`, then compare it to the Raw view on GitHub to make sure the copy is up to date.
3. **Eject and reset the badge** so the launcher indexes the new app.

## What You Added

The game builds a brick field using GitHub contribution colours, then lets you steer a paddle:

```python
for row in range(BRICK_ROWS):
    for col in range(BRICK_COLS):
        color = random.choice(COMMIT_COLORS)
        bricks.append(Brick(x, y, color))
...
if io.BUTTON_A in io.pressed:
    paddle.update(ball, auto_play=False)
```

Browse the full implementation for scoring, auto-play, and win states: [`badge/apps/commits/__init__.py`](https://github.com/badger/tufty/blob/main/badge/apps/commits/__init__.py#L0-L435).

## Verify

- Launch **Commits** from the menu.
- Move the paddle with `A`/`C`. Press `B` to launch the ball.
- Hold `DOWN` to enable the built-in auto-play helper and confirm it clears bricks.

## Cleanup (optional)

Move the Tufty download and extracted folder to the trash once you have verified the game launches.
