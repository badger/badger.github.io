# Chrome Dino Game

Experience the nostalgia of Chrome's offline dinosaur game right on your Badger 2350! This fully-featured game includes jumping mechanics, obstacle collision, score tracking, and even high score persistence.

## What You'll Learn

- Game loop programming
- Sprite animation and movement
- Collision detection
- File I/O for high score storage
- Custom bitmap image handling
- Button input processing

## Hardware Requirements

- Badger 2350
- USB-C cable for programming

## How to Play

- **UP Button**: Make the dino jump (also starts the game)
- **A Button**: Exit to launcher
- **Goal**: Avoid the cacti by jumping over them
- **Scoring**: Each cactus you pass increases your score

## Game Features

### Custom Sprite System
The game uses a custom sprite engine with:
```python
class MovingObject(Sprite):
    def __init__(self, x, y, image, display, ground=0, gravity=0):
        super().__init__(x, y, image, display)
        self.ground = ground
        self.gravity = gravity
        self.velocity_x = 0
        self.velocity_y = 0
        self.on_ground_flag = True
```

### Physics Engine
- Gravity simulation for realistic jumping
- Ground collision detection
- Momentum-based movement

### Dynamic Difficulty
```python
# Speed increases with score
for o in obstacles:
    if o.x <= -cactus_img.width:
        o.set_pos(x=display_width + random.randint(0, display_width))
        score += 1
        o.set_motion_vector(-1 - score * 0.05, 0)  # Faster with higher score
```

## Code Structure

### Game Objects
- **Player**: The jumping dinosaur sprite
- **Obstacles**: Moving cacti that must be avoided
- **Display**: Custom graphics rendering system

### Game States
1. **Start Screen**: Shows instructions and high score
2. **Game Loop**: Active gameplay with physics updates
3. **Game Over**: Score display and high score checking

### File Management
High scores are automatically saved and loaded:
```python
try:
    with io.open(high_score_path, "r") as f:
        high_score = int(f.readline())
except OSError:
    print("High score file not found")
```

## Installation

1. Copy these files to `/examples/` on your Badger 2350:
   - `dino.py`
   - `icon-dino.jpg` 
   - `dino.pbm` (dinosaur sprite)
   - `cactus.pbm` (obstacle sprite)
2. Launch via the app menu (A+C buttons)

## Customization Ideas

### Graphics Modifications
- Replace `dino.pbm` with your own 16x16 sprite
- Create new obstacle types by modifying `cactus.pbm`
- Adjust sprite sizes in the code

### Gameplay Tweaks
- Modify gravity: `gravity=0.02` (higher = faster falling)
- Change jump height by adjusting initial velocity
- Add power-ups or special obstacles

### Visual Enhancements
- Add background patterns
- Create particle effects for jumping
- Implement different terrains

## Technical Details

### Image Format
The game uses PBM (Portable Bitmap) format for sprites:
```python
class Image():
    def __init__(self, path):
        with open(path, "rb") as f:
            img_format = f.readline()
            if img_format != b"P4\n":
                print("Wrong image format")
                exit()
```

### Performance Optimization
- Uses `UPDATE_TURBO` for smooth animation
- Efficient collision detection
- Memory-conscious sprite handling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Sprites not loading**: Ensure `.pbm` files are in `/examples/`
- **Laggy gameplay**: Check that `UPDATE_TURBO` is set
- **High score not saving**: Verify write permissions on the device

### Controls Not Working
Make sure button handling is correct:
```python
if display.pressed(badger2040.BUTTON_UP) and player.on_ground():
    player.set_motion_vector(0, -2)  # Jump velocity
```

This game showcases the full potential of the Badger 2350 for interactive applications and demonstrates many core programming concepts that can be applied to other projects!
