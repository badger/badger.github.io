# Paginate the Launcher

The conference badge ships without menu pagination, so the launcher hides any app past slot six. Swap in the paginated `menu/__init__.py` from the Tufty repo to unlock scrolling.

## Prerequisites

- Badger 2350 connected over USB (mounted as the badger volume)
- Web browser and VS Code ready

## Steps

1. **Create an override copy of the menu app (first time only)**
   - Open the badger volume in Finder or File Explorer.
   - Copy `system/apps/menu` and paste it into `apps/` so you have `apps/menu` you can edit safely.
2. **Back up the current launcher file**
   - In Finder or File Explorer, duplicate `badger volume/apps/menu/__init__.py` and rename the duplicate to `__init__-backup.py` in the same folder (or drag a copy to your desktop).
3. **Grab the paginated source from GitHub**
   - In your browser, open [`badge/apps/menu/__init__.py`](https://github.com/badger/tufty/blob/main/badge/apps/menu/__init__.py).
   - Click **Raw**, select all, and copy the contents.
4. **Replace the launcher code in VS Code**
   - In VS Code, open `badger volume/apps/menu/__init__.py`.
   - Select the existing contents, paste the code you copied from the Raw view, and save the file.
5. **Eject the badger volume**, tap `Reset`, and let the badge reboot into the updated launcher.

## What Changed

The patched launcher keeps a moving window of six icons per page and wraps input between pages:

```python
APPS_PER_PAGE = 6
current_page = 0
...
if active >= len(icons):
    if current_page < total_pages - 1:
        current_page += 1
        icons = load_page_icons(current_page)
        active = 0
```

See the upstream file for the full implementation: [badge/apps/menu/__init__.py](https://github.com/badger/tufty/blob/main/badge/apps/menu/__init__.py#L31-L128).

## Verify

- From the launcher, press `C` until selection moves off the gridâ€”pagination should advance to the next set of apps.
- Confirm the page indicator (e.g. `1/2`) renders in the lower-right corner.

## Rollback

Restore the backup if you need the stock launcher:

Open the backup you made in step 2 (either the duplicate file beside `__init__.py` or the copy on your desktop), paste its contents back into `badger volume/apps/menu/__init__.py` with VS Code, save, and reboot the badge.
