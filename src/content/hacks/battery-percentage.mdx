# Show Battery Percentage

The stock launcher only fills the battery icon. Add monospace text so the header also shows the precise percentage.

## Prerequisites

- Badge mounted as the badger volume
- VS Code installed (we will edit directly on the mounted drive)

## Steps

1. **Put the menu UI under override** (if you have not already)
  - Open the badger volume in Finder or File Explorer.
  - Copy `system/apps/menu` into `apps/` so you have an editable `apps/menu` folder.
2. **Edit `badger volume/apps/menu/ui.py` in VS Code**
  - In VS Code, use **File â†’ Open...** to open the badger volume, then open `apps/menu/ui.py`.
  - In your browser, open the upstream [`menu/ui.py`](https://github.com/badger/tufty/blob/main/badge/apps/menu/ui.py), click **Raw**, and keep it handy for reference.
  - Update the imports at the top to include `PixelFont`:
     ```python
     from badgeware import brushes, shapes, io, screen, Matrix, get_battery_level, is_charging, PixelFont
     ```
  - Define a font for the meter label after the colour constants:
     ```python
     battery_font = PixelFont.load("/system/assets/fonts/nope.ppf")
     ```
  - Inside `draw_header()` (right after the block that fills the battery rectangle), insert:
     ```python
         screen.font = battery_font
         meter = "chg" if is_charging() else f"{int(round(battery_level)):3d}%"
         w, _ = screen.measure_text(meter)
         screen.text(meter, pos[0] - w - 4, pos[1])
     ```
     Full context to anchor your edit is in [`menu/ui.py`](https://github.com/badger/tufty/blob/main/badge/apps/menu/ui.py#L88-L114).
3. **Save the file in VS Code**, eject the badger volume, and tap `Reset` to reload the launcher.

## Verify

- Open the menu. You should see the numeric percentage (or `chg`) to the left of the battery icon.
- Press the buttons to ensure the header still animates; pagination and icons should behave as before.

## Rollback

If you need the stock file back, copy `system/apps/menu/ui.py` over the edited file using Finder or File Explorer, or paste the original contents back in VS Code from the GitHub Raw view.
