# Set Your GitHub Handle

The badge app refuses to fetch data until `GITHUB_USERNAME` and Wi-Fi credentials exist in `/secrets.py`. Fill them in so the stats screen lights up with your profile.

## Prerequisites

- Wi-Fi SSID and password for a 2.4 GHz network
- Your GitHub username (case-sensitive)

## Steps

1. **Enter USB storage mode** (double-tap `Reset`).
2. **Open the badger volume in VS Code** (`File → Open...` and choose the mounted drive).
3. **Locate `secrets.py`** at the root of the badger volume and edit it in VS Code, replacing the placeholder values:
   ```python
   WIFI_SSID = "your-ssid"
   WIFI_PASSWORD = "your-password"
   GITHUB_USERNAME = "your-handle"
   ```
4. **Save the file**, eject the badger volume, and tap `Reset` once.

## What the Badge Checks

```python
from secrets import WIFI_PASSWORD, WIFI_SSID, GITHUB_USERNAME
...
if not WIFI_SSID:
    return False
if not GITHUB_USERNAME:
    return False
user.handle = GITHUB_USERNAME
```

Reference: [`badge/apps/badge/__init__.py`](https://github.com/badger/tufty/blob/main/badge/apps/badge/__init__.py#L36-L78).

## Verify

- Launch the **Badge** app.
- Hold `A+C` to force refresh; within ~10 seconds you should see your avatar, follower count, and contribution graph.
- If you hit `Connection Failed`, double-check the Wi-Fi credentials.

## Safety Tips

- `secrets.py` is plain text. Avoid committing it to Git—it should stay on the badge only.
- To revert quickly, delete `/secrets.py` and reboot; the badge falls back to the built-in defaults.
