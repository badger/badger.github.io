# Install the Snake Game

Bring the GitHub-flavoured Snake minigame onto your badge by copying the upstream app folder and launching it from the menu.

## Prerequisites

- Badger 2350 in USB storage mode (`Reset` twice)
- Web browser and VS Code ready

## Steps

1. **Download the Tufty sources**
  - In a browser go to the [badger/home repository](https://github.com/badger/home).
  - Click **Code → Download ZIP** and save the archive.
  - Use Finder or File Explorer to unzip the download so you have a `tufty-main` folder.
2. **Copy the Snake app with Finder or File Explorer**
  - Open the extracted `tufty-main/badge/apps/snake` folder.
  - Open the badger volume in another window (`apps` lives at the top level; create it if it is missing).
  - Drag the entire `snake` folder onto `badger volume/apps/` to overwrite or create it.
3. **Verify the files in VS Code**
  - In VS Code, use **File → Open** and choose `badger volume/apps/snake/__init__.py` to confirm the file matches the upstream version (copy the contents from the Raw view on GitHub if you need to refresh it).
4. **Eject the badger volume**, tap `Reset` once, and open the launcher. The menu should show a new Snake tile.

## What You Added

Snake keeps state in RAM and wraps the grid when you cross an edge:

```python
new_head = ((head_x + dx) % GRID_WIDTH, (head_y + dy) % GRID_HEIGHT)
if new_head in self.segments:
    return False
self.segments.insert(0, new_head)
```

Review the full source for scoring and controls: [`badge/apps/snake/__init__.py`](https://github.com/badger/home/blob/main/badge/apps/snake/__init__.py#L31-L211).

## Verify

- Launch the Snake app from the badge menu.
- Press `A/C` to move left/right and `UP/DOWN` to move vertically.
- Eat a commit tile and confirm the score counter increments.

## Cleanup (optional)

Move the downloaded ZIP and extraction folder to the trash once you have confirmed Snake is running.
