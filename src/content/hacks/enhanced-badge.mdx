# Enhanced Badge Display (Badge++)

Transform your Badger 2350 into the ultimate personalized conference badge! This enhanced version goes beyond the basic badge app with custom profile pictures, multiple font options, and advanced personalization features.

## What You'll Learn

- Image loading and display (JPEG/PNG)
- Dynamic font rendering and sizing
- State management and persistence
- File system operations
- Advanced text layout algorithms
- Profile picture integration

## Hardware Requirements

- Badger 2350
- USB-C cable for programming
- Profile images (optional, can be downloaded)

## Controls

- **A/B Buttons**: Cycle through font options
- **UP/DOWN Buttons**: Switch between profile pictures
- **A+C**: Exit to launcher

## Key Features

### Multiple Font Support
Choose from 4 different professional fonts:
```python
FONTS = ["bitmap8", "serif", "sans", "gothic"]
THICKNESSES = [1, 4, 4, 2]
SIZE_ADJ = [1, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3]  # Scaling adjustments per font
```

### Profile Picture Support
Display custom profile images alongside your badge info:
```python
# Supports both JPEG and PNG formats
if image_path.endswith(".png"):
    png.open_file(image_path)
    png.decode(WIDTH - image_size, 0)
else:
    jpeg.open_file(image_path)
    jpeg.decode(WIDTH - image_size, 0)
```

### Smart Text Fitting
Automatically adjusts text size to fit within available space:
```python
def truncate_string(text, text_size, width):
    while display.measure_text(text, text_size) > width and len(text) > 0:
        text = text[:-1]
    return text
```

## Profile Picture Setup

### Automated Download Script
Use the included Python script to download GitHub profile pictures:

```python
# profile_pic_download.py
username = 'your-github-username'  # Replace with your username
response = requests.get(f'https://api.github.com/users/{username}')

if response.status_code == 200:
    image_url = response.json().get('avatar_url')
    
    # Download multiple sizes
    sizes = ['086', '100', '114', '128']
    for size in sizes:
        request_url = f'{image_url}&size={size}'
        # Download and save images...
```

### Manual Image Setup
1. **Prepare your images**: 
   - Supported formats: JPEG (.jpg) or PNG (.png)
   - Optimal sizes: 86px, 100px, 114px, or 128px wide
   - Images can be any height up to 128px

2. **Upload to badge**:
   - Create `/badges/` directory on your Badger 2350
   - Copy your images to this directory
   - Name them descriptively (e.g., `profile_100.jpg`)

## Customization File

### Badge Configuration
Create `/badges/badge.txt` with your information:
```
GitHub Universe 2024
Your First Name
Your Last Name  
Your Company
Your Title
your/pronouns
@your-handle
```

### Default Content
If no configuration file exists, the app creates one with sample data:
```python
DEFAULT_TEXT = """Universe 2024
Mona Lisa
Octocat
GitHub
Company Mascot
she/her
@mona
"""
```

## Advanced Features

### Dynamic Image Sizing
The app automatically extracts image dimensions from filenames:
```python
def extract_image_width_from_filename(filename):
    # Looks for pattern like "profile_128.jpg"
    match = re.search(r'_(\d+)\.[^.]+$', filename)
    return int(match.group(1)) if match else 0
```

### Responsive Layout
Adjusts text area based on image size:
```python
image_size = extract_image_width_from_filename(target_image)
TEXT_WIDTH = WIDTH - LEFT_PADDING - image_size

# If no image width found, use full width
if image_size == 0:
    image_size = WIDTH
```

### State Persistence
Remembers your font and image preferences:
```python
state = {
    "font_idx": 0,
    "picture_idx": 0
}
badger_os.state_load("badge++", state)
```

## Compatibility Features

### Universe 2023 Support
Includes backwards compatibility mode:
```python
BACK_COMPAT_MODE = False  # Set to True for 2023 badges

# PNG support check
if not BACK_COMPAT_MODE:
    import pngdec
    png = pngdec.PNG(display.display)
else:
    print("PNG library not available on Universe 2023 badge.")
```

### Graceful Fallbacks
- Handles missing image files
- Provides default text when configuration is missing
- Automatically adjusts layout for different screen sizes

## Text Rendering System

### Multi-Line Layout
Intelligent text positioning for different badge elements:
```python
# Name positioning
first_name_y = TEXT_Y_POS + NAME_HEIGHT
last_name_y = first_name_y + LASTNAME_HEIGHT + LINE_SPACING

# Details positioning  
title_y = last_name_y + DETAILS_HEIGHT + LINE_SPACING
pronouns_y = title_y + DETAILS_HEIGHT + LINE_SPACING
```

### Font Size Optimization
Different scaling for each font type:
```python
size_adjustment = SIZE_ADJ[state["font_idx"]]
adjusted_size = base_size * size_adjustment
```

## Installation

### Basic Setup
1. Copy these files to `/examples/`:
   - `badge++.py`
   - `icon-badge++.jpg`

### Full Setup with Images
1. Run `profile_pic_download.py` on your computer
2. Create `/badges/` directory on your Badger 2350  
3. Upload generated images to `/badges/`
4. Create your custom `badge.txt` file
5. Copy app files to `/examples/`

## Customization Ideas

### Personal Branding
- Use company logos or personal brand images
- Match fonts to your professional style
- Create themed image sets for different events

### Interactive Elements
- Add QR codes linking to your portfolio
- Include social media handles
- Display current project or interests

### Visual Enhancements
- Create animated transitions between images
- Add border styles around images
- Implement image filters or effects

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Displaying
- Check file formats (JPEG/PNG only)
- Verify files are in `/badges/` directory
- Ensure images aren't corrupted

### Text Overlap Issues
- Adjust `LINE_SPACING` constant
- Modify font size scaling in `SIZE_ADJ`
- Check text truncation settings

### Memory Issues
- Reduce image file sizes
- Use JPEG instead of PNG for better compression
- Clear unused images from `/badges/` directory

This enhanced badge app demonstrates professional-quality personalization and showcases advanced graphics capabilities of the Badger 2350!
