# Digital Pet Game

Bring back the nostalgia of virtual pets with this modern take on the classic Tamagotchi! Your Badger 2350 becomes home to a digital companion that needs care, attention, and love.

## Game Features

Your virtual pet will have:
- **Health & Happiness meters** - Keep them balanced!
- **Feeding system** - Various food types affect stats differently
- **Mini-games** - Play together to boost happiness
- **Evolution stages** - Watch your pet grow over time
- **Save system** - Your pet persists between sessions
- **Sound effects** - Audio feedback for interactions

## Pet Care Mechanics

### Health System
```python
class DigitalPet:
    def __init__(self, name="Badger"):
        self.name = name
        self.health = 100
        self.happiness = 100
        self.hunger = 0
        self.age = 0
        self.stage = "egg"
        self.last_fed = time.time()
        self.last_played = time.time()
    
    def update_stats(self):
        """Update pet stats based on time elapsed"""
        current_time = time.time()
        
        # Hunger increases over time
        time_since_fed = current_time - self.last_fed
        hunger_increase = time_since_fed / 3600  # Hungry every hour
        self.hunger = min(100, self.hunger + hunger_increase)
        
        # Health decreases if very hungry
        if self.hunger > 80:
            self.health = max(0, self.health - 1)
        
        # Happiness decreases without play
        time_since_played = current_time - self.last_played
        if time_since_played > 1800:  # 30 minutes
            self.happiness = max(0, self.happiness - 2)
```

### Feeding System
```python
def feed_pet(self, food_type):
    """Feed your pet different types of food"""
    foods = {
        "apple": {"hunger": -20, "health": +5, "happiness": +10},
        "candy": {"hunger": -30, "health": -5, "happiness": +20},
        "medicine": {"hunger": 0, "health": +30, "happiness": -10}
    }
    
    if food_type in foods:
        effects = foods[food_type]
        self.hunger = max(0, self.hunger + effects["hunger"])
        self.health = min(100, self.health + effects["health"])
        self.happiness = min(100, self.happiness + effects["happiness"])
        self.last_fed = time.time()
        
        # Play feeding sound
        play_sound("feed")
        return True
    return False
```

### Interactive Display
```python
def draw_pet_screen(pet):
    """Draw the main pet interface"""
    display.clear()
    
    # Pet sprite based on current state
    if pet.stage == "baby":
        draw_baby_sprite(150, 60)
    elif pet.stage == "adult":
        draw_adult_sprite(150, 60)
    
    # Status bars
    draw_status_bar("Health", pet.health, 10, 10, (255, 0, 0))
    draw_status_bar("Happy", pet.happiness, 10, 25, (0, 255, 0))
    draw_status_bar("Hunger", 100 - pet.hunger, 10, 40, (255, 255, 0))
    
    # Pet name and age
    display.text(f"{pet.name} (Age: {pet.age})", 10, 100, scale=1)
    
    # Action prompts
    display.text("A:Feed B:Play C:Clean", 10, 115, scale=1)
    
    display.update()

def draw_status_bar(label, value, x, y, color):
    """Draw a status bar with label and current value"""
    bar_width = 100
    filled_width = int((value / 100) * bar_width)
    
    # Bar background
    display.rect(x + 50, y, bar_width, 8, outline=True)
    
    # Filled portion (simulated with characters)
    filled_chars = "â–ˆ" * (filled_width // 10)
    display.text(f"{label}: {filled_chars}", x, y, scale=1)
```

## Mini-Games

### Reaction Game
```python
def play_reaction_game(pet):
    """Quick reaction mini-game"""
    display.clear()
    display.text("Get Ready...", 100, 60, scale=2)
    display.update()
    
    # Random delay
    time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 4))
    
    display.clear()
    display.text("PRESS A!", 100, 60, scale=2)
    display.update()
    
    start_time = time.time()
    
    while True:
        if not button_a.value():  # Button pressed
            reaction_time = time.time() - start_time
            if reaction_time < 1.0:
                pet.happiness = min(100, pet.happiness + 15)
                display.text("Great job!", 100, 80, scale=1)
                play_sound("success")
            else:
                pet.happiness = min(100, pet.happiness + 5)
                display.text("Not bad!", 100, 80, scale=1)
            break
        
        if time.time() - start_time > 3:
            display.text("Too slow!", 100, 80, scale=1)
            play_sound("fail")
            break
    
    pet.last_played = time.time()
    display.update()
    time.sleep(2)
```

## Sound & Audio

```python
from machine import PWM
import time

def play_sound(sound_type):
    """Play different sound effects"""
    buzzer = PWM(Pin(15))
    
    sounds = {
        "feed": [(523, 0.1), (659, 0.1)],  # C, E
        "play": [(659, 0.1), (784, 0.1), (988, 0.1)],  # E, G, B
        "success": [(523, 0.1), (659, 0.1), (784, 0.2)],  # C, E, G
        "fail": [(311, 0.3)],  # Eb (sad sound)
        "alert": [(1047, 0.1)] * 3  # High C beeps
    }
    
    if sound_type in sounds:
        for freq, duration in sounds[sound_type]:
            buzzer.freq(freq)
            buzzer.duty(512)  # 50% duty cycle
            time.sleep(duration)
            buzzer.duty(0)
            time.sleep(0.05)
```

## Save System

```python
import json

def save_pet(pet):
    """Save pet data to file"""
    pet_data = {
        "name": pet.name,
        "health": pet.health,
        "happiness": pet.happiness,
        "hunger": pet.hunger,
        "age": pet.age,
        "stage": pet.stage,
        "last_fed": pet.last_fed,
        "last_played": pet.last_played
    }
    
    try:
        with open("pet_save.json", "w") as f:
            json.dump(pet_data, f)
        return True
    except:
        return False

def load_pet():
    """Load pet data from file"""
    try:
        with open("pet_save.json", "r") as f:
            pet_data = json.load(f)
        
        pet = DigitalPet(pet_data["name"])
        pet.health = pet_data["health"]
        pet.happiness = pet_data["happiness"] 
        pet.hunger = pet_data["hunger"]
        pet.age = pet_data["age"]
        pet.stage = pet_data["stage"]
        pet.last_fed = pet_data["last_fed"]
        pet.last_played = pet_data["last_played"]
        
        return pet
    except:
        # Create new pet if no save file
        return DigitalPet()
```

## Evolution System

Your pet grows and changes over time:

- **Egg** (0-2 hours): Just hatched, very needy
- **Baby** (2-12 hours): Playful and curious  
- **Teen** (12-48 hours): Independent but moody
- **Adult** (48+ hours): Mature and wise

## Tips for Success

1. **Check regularly** - Your pet needs attention throughout the day
2. **Balance stats** - Don't just focus on one aspect
3. **Play games** - Mini-games boost happiness quickly
4. **Watch for alerts** - Your pet will beep when it needs care
5. **Experiment with food** - Different foods have different effects

This project teaches game design, persistent data storage, and creates an engaging interactive experience!

## Expansions

- Add more pet types and species
- Create breeding mechanics
- Implement pet-to-pet interactions
- Add seasonal events and activities
