# Add Your Photo to Gallery

The Gallery app scans its `images/` and `thumbnails/` folders at boot. Add a matching PNG pair to make your art appear in the reel.

## Prerequisites

- Badge mounted as the badger volume
- An image editor that can export PNGs at specific dimensions (Preview on macOS, Paint or Photos on Windows, or an online tool)

## Steps

1. **Copy the Gallery app into override mode (first time only)**
  - Open the badger volume in Finder or File Explorer.
  - Duplicate the folder `system/apps/gallery` and move the copy to `apps/gallery`. This lets you edit the override version without touching the system copy.
2. **Prepare the full-size artwork (160×120)**
  - Open your source image in the image editor.
  - Resize or export it to exactly **160×120 px** and save it as `badge-shot.png` (use any name you like) on your desktop.
3. **Create the thumbnail (60×45)**
  - Duplicate the 160×120 PNG in your editor.
  - Resize the duplicate to **60×45 px** and save it as `badge-shot-thumb.png`.
4. **Copy both files into the app with Finder or File Explorer**
  - Drag `badge-shot.png` into `badger volume/apps/gallery/images/`.
  - Drag `badge-shot-thumb.png` into `badger volume/apps/gallery/thumbnails/` and rename it so the filename matches the full-size version (for example, `badge-shot.png`).
5. **Review in VS Code**
  - In VS Code, open `badger volume/apps/gallery/` and make sure your two PNGs appear under `images/` and `thumbnails/` with matching names.
6. **Eject and reset** the badge so Gallery refreshes its file list.

## What the App Looks For

```python
files = []
for file in os.listdir("images"):
    name, ext = file.rsplit(".", 1)
    if ext == "png":
        files.append({"name": file, "title": name.replace("-", " ")})
...
thumbnails.append(Image.load(f"thumbnails/{file['name']}"))
```

The code expects a PNG in both `images/` and `thumbnails/` using the same filename. Source: [`badge/apps/gallery/__init__.py`](https://github.com/badger/home/blob/main/badge/apps/gallery/__init__.py#L10-L71).

## Verify

- Launch Gallery and scroll with `A/C` until you hit your new tile.
- Confirm the thumbnail strip shows your preview and the title uses the file name (dashes become spaces).

## Troubleshooting

- If the image fails to load, check for uppercase file extensions or mismatched thumbnail names.
- Use `Reset` twice to drop back into USB mode and replace any broken files.
